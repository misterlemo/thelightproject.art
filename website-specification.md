### Artist Information

**Artist Name:** Maria-Efimia Dimoka

**Project Title:** Dance of the Shadows

**Artist Statement (Full):**

"My works arise from photographs I take throughout the day. I find joy in later discovering details in these images—details that involve a certain interplay of light and shadow. This is how I create new images. Through this process, I illuminate an aspect of reality that is not immediately obvious. I then transfer these images onto the canvas.

My mobile phone becomes a witness to fleeting reality, just as fleeting as light itself. It moves so quickly—the lines of shadow shift, intensities change, colors transform. A true game, and I choose to play this game by capturing the moment.

Time is a strong element in my work. It is obvious that a minute later, an entirely different piece would have emerged. Different colors, different forms, a different mood—and above all, a different emotion.

Are my works photorealistic? No. Not at all. I intentionally use flat, solid colors in the background and even in the main subject, so that the viewer oddly focuses on the shadow, and the emotion emerges primarily from the shadow's presence.

I love pure colors. That's why I decided to create paintings that could be categorized into the three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. As an ode to color, an ode to light. Three paintings for each of these primary colors."

**Artistic Philosophy (Additional from PDF):**

"A favorite Greek painter from whom I often draw inspiration is Panayiotis Tetsis. His works speak in the language of color and light—Greek light: intense, rich, and so radiant.

I also love something the architect Luis Kahn once said: 'The sun never knew how great it was until it hit the side of a building or lit up a room.' In a way, my paintings reflect this exact sentiment.

'The purpose of light is to create shadows, and shadows exist to create emotion.' Again, from the notes of Luis Kahn. We recognize the value of light—but where there is light, there is also shadow. One cannot exist without the other. Shadow gives light its value, it highlights it, creates atmosphere and emotion, gives space its three-dimensional form. Much of light's beauty is hidden in the play of shadows it casts. And at the same time, shadows have the power to play with light and enchant the viewer, evoking different feelings each time.

Shadow alone scares me, much like it scared Bucephalus, in a symbolic way. I don't like it when it is large, persistent, deeply dark, or hides secrets. I like it when it coexists with light or vivid colors. I also prefer its playful nature—when it distorts even the forms of objects. I enjoy the visual games created by light and shadow in less obvious combinations. Sometimes, reality can be so altered by the presence of shadows that one begins to question what they are really seeing—what piece of a larger puzzle it might be."

### THE PROJECT (Concept Section)

**Section Heading:** The Project

**Body Copy:**

*Dance of the Shadows* is an exploration of light's most overlooked companion: the shadow. Through nine handmade acrylic paintings, this body of work captures the ephemeral interplay between light and shadow in the Greek landscape—moments so fleeting they exist for mere minutes before transforming entirely.

Each painting begins with a photograph taken throughout the day, a witness to reality as transient as light itself. These images reveal details not immediately obvious: the way sunlight slips through Cycladic cracks, how railings cast rhythmic shadows on curtains, or the optical illusions created by intense Mediterranean light on a ship's deck.

The work is organized into three series—*Shadows in Blue*, *Shadows in Red*, and *Shadows in Yellow*—an ode to the primary colors and to light itself. Using flat, solid colors intentionally, the focus shifts to the shadow, where emotion emerges most powerfully.

Inspired by the radiant language of Greek painter Panayiotis Tetsis and architect Luis Kahn's observation that "the sun never knew how great it was until it hit the side of a building or lit up a room," these paintings reflect a simple truth: light and shadow cannot exist without each other. Shadow gives light its value, creates atmosphere, and transforms space into something three-dimensional and alive.

### ABOUT THE ARTIST

**Section Heading:** About the Artist

**Body Copy:**

Maria-Efimia Dimoka is a contemporary Greek artist whose work explores the profound relationship between light and shadow in everyday moments. Based in Greece, she creates original handmade paintings that capture the unique quality of Greek light—intense, rich, and radiant.

Her artistic process begins with her mobile phone, which becomes a witness to fleeting reality. Throughout the day, she photographs moments where light and shadow create unexpected beauty: the way sunlight transforms a staircase into a linear pattern, how shadows dance across curtains, or the optical illusions created by Mediterranean light. These photographs become the foundation for her paintings, where she illuminates aspects of reality not immediately obvious to the eye.

Maria-Efimia works exclusively with acrylic paints, a medium she chose initially out of necessity while pregnant with her second child, when oil paint fumes would have been dangerous. Over time, she discovered that acrylic's immediacy perfectly matches her artistic goal: capturing specific moments in time. Just as the drying time of acrylic paint is fleeting, so too are the moments of light and shadow she paints.

Time is a central element in her work. Each painting represents a moment that, a minute later, would have been entirely different—different colors, different forms, a different mood, and above all, a different emotion. By using flat, solid colors intentionally, she directs the viewer's focus to the shadow itself, where emotion emerges most powerfully.

Drawing inspiration from Greek painter Panayiotis Tetsis and architect Luis Kahn's philosophy on light and shadow, Maria-Efimia has developed a distinctive visual language. Her *Dance of the Shadows* series—organized into three primary colors (blue, red, and yellow)—serves as an ode to both color and light.

All works are created in a manageable yet functional size of 120 × 120 cm, making them suitable for both private collections and gallery spaces.

Maria-Efimia is a mother of two—a 6-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl—and continues to create her work from her studio in Greece, where the quality of light remains her greatest inspiration.
